        <h2>The story behind Christmas: </h2>
		<p>
            The most well-known holiday around the world
            is Christmas. It is celebrated by Christians 
            around the world as a means of celebrating the 
            birth of Jesus Christ. 
        </p>

        <h2>How Christmas is celebrated: </h2>
		<p>
			Christmas is celebrated on the 25th of December
            every year. Families will gather around a Christmas
            tree and give each other gifts. It is a time of 
            celebration and warmth.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Christmas activities: </h2>
		<p>
			Another important element of Christmas is Santa 
            Claus: a mythical man who visits the homes of children
            across the world on the night before Christmas
            and gives them a gift based on if they were "naughty
            or nice" that year. 
        </p>
